# nvim
My experiments with Neovim config. 

Learning to work with Vim and trying out the plugins which make it easier to work with.

I am mostly interested in using NVim for
* coding, 
* documenting, 
* writing, and,
* editing. 

At some point I want to check out orgmode too but that is not a priority.
